Tomato Dosa

Preparation Time: 25 minutes
Cooking Time: 1 hour
Serves: 3

Ingredients
Rice - 250 gms
Tur dal - 50 gms
Ripe red tomatoes - 2 big
Dry red chillies - 7-8 (deseeded)
Asafoetida (Hing) - a pinch
Cumin seeds - 1/4 tsp
Salt - 1 tsp
Jaggery - 1 tsp
Chopped coriander leaves - 3 tbsp
Oil
Method
Wash and soak the rice, tur dal and dry red chilies for 2 hrs.
Grind along with all the other ingredients and keep it for fermentation overnight.
Add the chopped coriander leaves just before making the dosas. Usually, I grind the batter around 10:30 in the night and used it by 5:00 am in the morning.
The batter should be of dosa consistency.
Make the dosas as you make the normal dosas.
Serving Suggestion
serve the hot tomato dosa with some chutney.
